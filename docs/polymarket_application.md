### Application Fields

**Your Project:**
`@SabiMarkets`

**Product Name:**
SabiMarkets

**Project Description:**
SabiMarkets is a localized, high-performance interface and aggregator built on top of Polymarket’s liquidity. Recognizing that Polymarket's default UI heavily caters to US-centric events (US politics, sports, indices), SabiMarkets dynamically filters, surfaces, and promotes markets related to the 54 African countries, their economies, leaders, and global events that impact emerging markets. We provide a tailored, mobile-responsive "dark mode native" terminal that allows African users to bet on the outcomes that directly affect their daily lives, driving entirely new volume to Polymarket from one of the fastest-growing Web3 demographics.
